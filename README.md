## Masonry Grid Gallery Assets

MASONRIC's grid is powered by [markmead's AlpineJS-Masonry plugin](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-masonry). You can customize the number of columns (between 1 to 12) for the gallery to fit your needs in the Global settings. All the pictures displayed on the home page are in the "Gallery" asset container and uses the File Driver Disk "gallery" already configured in config/filesystems.php. The following fieldsets are available for the gallery pictures :
- Alt Text (optional)
- Linked entry (optional)
- Credits (optional)

## Collections

There are two collections **Entries** and **Pages**. Each entry is a blog post that will show in the Blog page. The main pages "About", "Blog" and "Contact" can be found in the Pages collection. By default, each page will appear in the navigation menu, a toggle option to **Show in navigation** is available to hide them from the navigation, however this mean you will need to find an alternative way to link to them.
